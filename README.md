# You-Tube-clone
This is a YouTube clone, this is only the home page of YouTube I made with HTML and CSS. This page is not responsive for now as it doesn't have any JavaScript. I made it with the help of sSuperSimpleDev by following along with their YouTube tutorial. For a better understanding you can get the head over to their website or YouTube channel to get the source code as well.
This tutorial give me a better understanding of nested loops, CSS grid, flexbox and many more things.
